## What's Coming

Webhooks will enable real-time notifications when feedback data changes, allowing you to build powerful automation:

- Send Slack notifications for low NPS scores
- Trigger real-time dashboard updates
- Sync data to your data warehouse or CRM
- Route urgent feedback to support teams automatically

## Planned Event Types

### `feedback_record.created`

Triggered when new feedback is created via `POST /v1/feedback-records`.

**Use cases:**
- Send notifications for important feedback
- Update real-time dashboards
- Start data processing pipelines

### `feedback_record.updated`

Triggered when feedback is manually updated via `PATCH /v1/feedback-records/{id}`.

**Use cases:**
- Audit trail logging
- Sync changes to external systems
- Update cached analytics

### `feedback_record.deleted`

Triggered when feedback is deleted via `DELETE /v1/feedback-records/{id}`.

**Use cases:**
- Maintain data consistency across systems
- Update aggregated metrics
- Compliance logging (GDPR deletion tracking)
