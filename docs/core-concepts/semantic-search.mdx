<Info>
  Semantic Search is planned for a future release. This page outlines what's coming.
</Info>

## What's Coming

Semantic search will let you find feedback using natural language queries. Unlike keyword search, it understands:

- **Synonyms**: "expensive" matches "costly", "pricey", "too much money"
- **Intent**: "hard to use" matches "confusing interface", "complicated UX"
- **Context**: "checkout issues" matches "payment failed", "cart problems", "order won't submit"

### Example

**Your query:** "mobile app crashes"

**Matches found:**
- "The iOS app keeps freezing and shutting down" (88% match)
- "Android version crashes on startup" (86% match)
- "App is unstable, crashes frequently" (84% match)

## Planned Capabilities

- **Find similar feedback** - "Show me all checkout issues" finds related problems even with different wording
- **Query in plain English** - Ask questions like a human, get relevant answers
- **Discover patterns** - Find themes across thousands of responses instantly
- **Support workflows** - "Find feedback like this support ticket" for faster resolution
- **Analyze themes** - Group similar feedback without manual tagging

## How It Will Work

1. When text feedback is created, Hub generates a vector embedding
2. Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text
3. Search queries are converted to embeddings
4. Nearest neighbor search finds semantically similar feedback
5. Results ranked by similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)

This will be powered by OpenAI's embedding models and pgvector for fast vector search in PostgreSQL.
