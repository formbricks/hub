## What's Coming

Formbricks Hub will support an open ecosystem of connectors for importing and exporting feedback data.

### Why Connectors?

Feedback data lives in many places:

- **App stores** (Apple App Store, Google Play)
- **Review platforms** (Trustpilot, G2, Capterra)
- **Survey tools** (Typeform, Google Forms)
- **Support platforms** (Zendesk, Intercom)
- **Social media** (Twitter, Reddit)

Connectors will enable you to:

- **Centralize feedback** from all sources into one unified repository
- **Build custom workflows** specific to your tools and processes
- **Share connectors** with the community
- **Self-host everything** - no vendor lock-in, full data ownership

## Planned Connector Types
