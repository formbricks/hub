## What's Coming

AI Enrichment will automatically analyze text feedback to extract:

| Field | Type | Description | Example Values |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------|
| `sentiment` | string | Overall polarity | `"positive"`, `"negative"`, `"neutral"`, `"mixed"` |
| `sentiment_score` | float | Confidence (-1.0 to +1.0) | `-0.8` (very negative), `0.6` (positive) |
| `emotion` | string | Primary emotional tone | `"joy"`, `"frustration"`, `"anger"`, `"sadness"` |
| `topics` | array | Key themes/subjects | `["pricing", "dashboard", "performance"]` |

## Planned Capabilities

- **Alert on negative sentiment** - Get notified when customers are frustrated
- **Route by emotion** - Send feedback to the right team based on emotional tone
- **Analyze trends** - Track sentiment over time without manual categorization
- **Discover themes** - Automatically identify recurring topics
- **Query by feeling** - Find all "frustrated" customers or "joyful" feedback

## How It Will Work

1. Create a text feedback record via the API
2. Hub queues the record for background processing
3. Text is sent to an LLM (like GPT-4o-mini) for analysis
4. Sentiment, emotion, and topics are extracted and stored
5. A webhook fires when enrichment completes

Processing will be asynchronous so your API stays fast. Typical enrichment will complete within 5-15 seconds.
