## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go 1.23+** - [Download](https://go.dev/dl/)
- **PostgreSQL 18** - Via Docker (recommended) or local installation
- **Python 3.11+** - For data import scripts
- **pnpm 9+** - [Install](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Local Development Setup

**1. Fork and clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/store.git
cd store
```

**2. Start the infrastructure:**

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
docker compose up -d
```

**3. Run the Store API:**

```bash
cd apps/store
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration:
# - SERVICE_API_KEY=your-development-api-key
# - SERVICE_OPEN_AI_KEY=sk-... (optional, for AI enrichment)

# Run the API in development mode
make dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8888`

**4. Run the documentation site (optional):**

```bash
cd apps/docs
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The docs will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
# Test the API
curl http://localhost:8888/health

# Run Go tests
cd apps/store
make test

# Run linter
make lint
```

## üìù Code Standards

We maintain high code quality standards to ensure the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

### Go Code (Store API)

- **Format**: Use `gofmt` (or `make fmt`)
- **Linter**: Use `golangci-lint` (or `make lint`)
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- **Error handling**: Always handle errors explicitly
- **Comments**: Document exported functions and types

```bash
# Format code
cd apps/store
make fmt

# Run linter
make lint

# Run tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript (Documentation)

- **Format**: Prettier (automatically run on commit)
- **Lint**: ESLint (automatically run on commit)
- **Style**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase

```bash
# Format all code
pnpm format

# Check formatting
pnpm format:check

# Run linter
pnpm lint
```

### Python (Import Scripts)

- **Format**: Use `black` for formatting
- **Linter**: Use `flake8` or `ruff`
- **Type hints**: Add type annotations where appropriate
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for functions

## üîÄ Git Workflow

### Commit Messages

We use **Conventional Commits** for clear and structured commit history. This is enforced by `commitlint` (pre-commit hook coming soon).

**Format**: `type(scope): description`

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(api): add batch import endpoint"
git commit -m "fix(enrichment): handle OpenAI timeout errors"
git commit -m "docs(api): update authentication guide"
git commit -m "chore(deps): update go dependencies"
```

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `feat/add-batch-import` - New features
- `fix/enrichment-timeout` - Bug fixes
- `docs/api-examples` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/worker-pool` - Code refactoring

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`

2. **Make your changes** following the code standards

3. **Write or update tests** for your changes

4. **Run tests and linters locally:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/store
   make test
   make lint
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** using Conventional Commits

6. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

7. **Fill out the PR template** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Related issue number (if applicable)
   - Type of change (bug fix, feature, etc.)
   - Testing approach

8. **Wait for review** - A maintainer will review your PR
   - Address any feedback or requested changes
   - Keep the PR up to date with `main` if needed

9. **Celebrate!** üéâ Once merged, you're an official contributor!

### PR Checklist

Before submitting your PR, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`make test`)
- [ ] Linter passes (`make lint`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated (if needed)
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] No breaking changes (or clearly documented)

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Go Tests

All new features and bug fixes must include tests:

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration tests**: Test API endpoints with real database
- **Table-driven tests**: Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios

```go
func TestCreateExperience(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   CreateExperienceInput
        wantErr bool
    }{
        // test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // test logic
        })
    }
}
```

Run tests:
```bash
cd apps/store
make test
```

### Documentation Tests

Ensure documentation builds without errors:

```bash
cd apps/docs
pnpm build
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building Connectors

Want to add support for a new data source? Here's how:

1. **Create a new directory** in `scripts/data-imports/your-source/`

2. **Add import script** (`import.py`) that:
   - Fetches data from the external API
   - Maps data to Store's field types
   - Calls Store's REST API

3. **Include documentation**:
   - `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions
   - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
   - `.env.example` - Required environment variables

4. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Test with real data
   - Test pagination (if applicable)
   - Test error handling

5. **Submit a PR** with:
   - Import script
   - Documentation
   - Example SQL queries

See existing connectors in `scripts/data-imports/` for examples.

## üì¶ Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers via GitHub Releases:

1. Create a new release with a semantic version tag (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
2. GitHub Actions automatically builds and pushes Docker images to `ghcr.io`
3. Release notes are generated from commit messages
4. Docker images are tagged with version numbers

Contributors don't need to worry about releases - just focus on great code!

## üí¨ Questions?

- **GitHub Discussions**: Ask questions, share ideas, get help
