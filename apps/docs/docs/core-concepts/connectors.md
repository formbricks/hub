# Connectors

:::info Coming Soon
The connector ecosystem is under active development. This page outlines our vision for the future.
:::

## Vision

Formbricks Hub will support an **open ecosystem of connectors** for importing and exporting experience data.

### Why Connectors?

Experience data lives in many places:
- **App hubs** (Apple App Store, Google Play)
- **Review platforms** (Trustpilot, G2, Capterra)
- **Survey tools** (Typeform, Google Forms)
- **Support platforms** (Zendesk, Intercom)
- **Social media** (Twitter, Reddit)

Connectors will enable you to:
- ✅ **Centralize feedback** from all sources into one unified repository
- ✅ **Build custom workflows** specific to your tools and processes
- ✅ **Share connectors** with the community
- ✅ **Self-host everything** - no vendor lock-in, full data ownership

## Planned Connector Types

### Source Connectors (Import)

Source connectors will pull experience data **into** Hub from external platforms:

- **App Store & Google Play** - Mobile app reviews
- **Review Platforms** - Trustpilot, G2, Capterra
- **Survey Tools** - Typeform, Google Forms
- **Support Platforms** - Zendesk, Intercom
- **Social Media** - Twitter, Reddit
- **Custom APIs** - Connect any REST API

### Destination Connectors (Export)

Destination connectors will push experience data **from** Hub to external systems:

- **Data Warehouses** - Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery
- **Business Intelligence** - Tableau, Power BI
- **Webhooks** - Any HTTP endpoint (already available via Hub's built-in webhook system)
