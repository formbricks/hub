This would make the flow much faster and smoother, especially on mobile. It’s a common pattern in modern survey tools like Typeform and Tally, and it significantly improves completion rates.

Ideally, this could be:

Enabled by default for single select questions

Or offered as a toggle in the question settings (e.g. “Auto-advance when option is selected”)"

Specifically the use of variables 

For example, in the editor:  

If I enter a question ""How likely is it first_name will attend event_name on event_date?"" to get the variables I have to type @ for teh drop down each time in sequence as I enter  the question.  But, if I go back and try to edit the question, e.g. ""How likely is it first_name last_name will attend event_name on event_date?"" then: 

Firstly: I can't go back and edit the question at the point at whicnh I want to instert the additional variable - i.e. insterting @ doesn't bring up the list of variables.  Instead I have to erase the rest of the question and re-type it from scratch from that point.

Secondly: a lot of the time Formbricks dumps the other variables as soon as the question is edited, and I end up with ""How likely is it @first_name last_name will attend @event_name on @event_date?"" 

When trying to use the variables in a URL,  Formbricks doesn't consistently work.  For example this URL construction only correctly populates the first_name and ignores the other fields, for no obvious reason:
