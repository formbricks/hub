                Verify the signature using your webhook's signing_key (see Standard Webhooks spec).
                Outbound request timeout is 15 seconds (per Standard Webhooks recommendation).

                The webhook-id header is a stable identifier per event: the same value is sent for every delivery attempt (all endpoints and all retries) for that event. Use it as an idempotency key (e.g. store seen IDs for a short window and skip duplicate processing).
