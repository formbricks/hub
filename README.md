## 🎯 Overview

**Formbricks Hub** is an open-source unified experience data repository that solves the challenge of scattered customer feedback across multiple platforms. It provides a centralized system to collect, enrich with AI, and analyze feedback from surveys, product reviews, support tickets, and social media.

### The Problem

Customer feedback is scattered across multiple platforms:
- Survey tools (Formbricks, Typeform, Google Forms)
- Review sites (G2, Trustpilot, App Store)
- Support systems (Zendesk, Intercom)
- Social media (Twitter, Reddit)

Each platform has different data formats, making it impossible to get a unified view of customer sentiment and experience.

### The Solution

Hub provides:

✅ **Unified Data Model** - All feedback sources mapped to a single, analytics-optimized schema  
✅ **AI-Powered Enrichment** - Automatic sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and topic extraction  
✅ **BI-Ready Structure** - Optimized for tools like Apache Superset, Tableau, Power BI  
✅ **Real-time Webhooks** - React to new feedback immediately  
✅ **Cross-Source Analytics** - Analyze patterns across reviews, surveys, and support tickets

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Analytics-First Data Model

Hub uses a **narrow format** (one row per question-answer pair) optimized for SQL aggregations and BI tools. No complex JSON unnesting, no wide tables—just simple, queryable data:

```sql
-- Direct aggregation without JSON unnesting
SELECT sentiment, COUNT(*) as feedback_count
FROM experience_data 
WHERE field_type = 'text' AND collected_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY sentiment;

-- Find all frustrated users mentioning "checkout"
SELECT value_text, sentiment_score, topics
FROM experience_data
WHERE emotion = 'frustration' 
  AND 'checkout' = ANY(topics);
```

### 🤖 AI-Powered Insights

Automatically enrich every text response with actionable insights using OpenAI:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive, negative, neutral, or mixed with confidence scores (-1.0 to +1.0)
- **Emotion Detection**: Joy, frustration, anger, confusion, sadness automatically identified
- **Topic Extraction**: Automatically discover themes like pricing, UI, bugs, support—no manual tagging
- **Semantic Search**: Query feedback by meaning, not keywords: *"users frustrated with checkout"*
- **Vector Embeddings**: Powered by `pgvector` for fast similarity search at scale

**All AI processing happens asynchronously**—your API stays fast (~20-50ms response time) while enrichment runs in the background. Results appear within 5-15 seconds via webhook notifications.

**Cost-efficient**: ~$0.015 per 1,000 text responses with `gpt-4o-mini`.

### 🔌 Multi-Source Support

Centralize feedback from anywhere through our simple REST API:

- **Surveys**: Formbricks, Typeform, Google Forms, SurveyMonkey
- **Reviews**: G2, Trustpilot, Capterra (includes [G2 import script](scripts/data-imports/g2-reviews/))
- **App Stores**: Apple App Store, Google Play (coming soon)
- **Support**: Zendesk, Intercom, Help Scout (coming soon)
- **Social**: Twitter, Reddit (coming soon)
- **Custom**: Any source via REST API or Python scripts

### 📈 BI-Ready Analytics

Direct PostgreSQL access means instant integration with any SQL-compatible tool:

- **Real-time Dashboards**: Apache Superset, Metabase, Redash
- **Enterprise BI**: Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Qlik
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery (export ready)
- **Custom SQL**: Write queries in your favorite tool

**Example queries:**
- Weekly NPS trends by source
- Sentiment distribution over time
- Most mentioned topics this month
- Emotion breakdowns by product area

### 🎯 Real-Time Webhooks

React to feedback the moment it arrives with reliable webhook delivery:

- **Event Types**: `experience.created`, `experience.enriched`, `experience.updated`, `experience.deleted`
- **Reliable Delivery**: Worker pool with 3 retries and exponential backoff
- **Fast**: 5-second timeout per webhook, never blocks API responses
- **Flexible**: Send to Slack, Zapier, n8n, or custom endpoints

**Use cases:**
- Alert Support when negative sentiment detected
- Trigger workflows when specific topics appear
- Sync to external systems in real-time
- Update dashboards immediately

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in under 5 minutes with Docker.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Installation

**1. Download the production Docker Compose file:**

```bash
mkdir formbricks-hub && cd formbricks-hub
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/hub/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
```

**2. Configure your environment:**

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Required: Secure passwords
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
SERVICE_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Optional: OpenAI for AI enrichment and semantic search
SERVICE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# Optional: Configuration
SERVICE_PORT=8080
SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

💡 **Note**: Without `SERVICE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, Hub works perfectly but won't enrich text feedback with sentiment/topics or support semantic search.

**3. Start the services:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:
- **Formbricks Hub API** (port 8080)
- **PostgreSQL** (port 5432)

**4. Verify it's running:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

### Basic Usage

**Create an experience with text feedback (automatic AI enrichment):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/experiences \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_SERVICE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_type": "survey",
    "source_id": "nps-2025-q1",
    "field_id": "feedback",
    "field_label": "What can we improve?",
    "field_type": "text",
    "value_text": "The checkout process is confusing and slow. Very frustrating!",
    "collected_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }'
```

Within seconds, Hub automatically enriches the feedback with:
- **Sentiment**: `negative` (score: -0.8)
- **Emotion**: `frustration`
- **Topics**: `["checkout", "user_experience", "performance"]`

**Query feedback:**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/experiences?limit=10" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_SERVICE_API_KEY"
```

**Search feedback by meaning (semantic search):**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/experiences/search?q=frustrated%20checkout&limit=10" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_SERVICE_API_KEY"
```
